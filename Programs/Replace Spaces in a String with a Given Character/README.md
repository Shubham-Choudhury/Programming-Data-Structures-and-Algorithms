# Replace Spaces in a String with a Given Character

`Deloitte NLA [for BCA/B.Sc(CS/IT)]`

Given string str and a character ch as inputs, write a program to print the resultant string by replacing every space in str with the given character.

Read the input from STDIN and print the output to STDOUT. Do not write arbitrary strings anywhere in the program, as these contribute to the standard output, and test cases will fail.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ length of Str ≤ 100
- Str can be either lowercase alphabet, uppercase alphabet, or both
- Ch can be either a lower or uppercase character

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains a string Str.
- The second line of input contains a character Ch.

## Output Format

- A single line of output should contain the resultant string.

### Sample Input

```
Welcome to my home
b
```

### Sample Output

```
Welcomebtobmybhome
```

### Explanation

- Given string Str is "Welcome to my home" and the given character is 'b'.
- Replacing every space with 'b', will get the output as "Welcomebtobmybhome".
