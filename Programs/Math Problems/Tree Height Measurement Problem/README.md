# Tree Height Measurement Problem

`IBM-Associate System Engineer`

## Problem Statement

A man is assigned a task to measure the height of vertical trees in a garden. He uses an instrument to measure the angle of elevation of the top of a tree. The instrument is held 1.8 meters above ground level.

When the man is 19 meters away from the base of a tree, he measures the angle of elevation as 56Â°.

Using this data, the total height of the tree is calculated using trigonometry. The final height is rounded up using the ceiling function, resulting in 30 meters.

You are required to write a program that computes the height of the tree based on the given angle and distance.

## Input

The input consists of two values: the distance from the base of the tree (in meters) and the angle of elevation (in degrees). The distance is a positive integer, and the angle is a positive integer between 0 and 90 degrees.

## Output

The output should be a single integer representing the height of the tree in meters, rounded up to the nearest whole number.

## Example

### Input

```
19 56
```

### Output

```
30
```

## Constraints

- The distance from the base of the tree is a positive integer.
- The angle of elevation is a positive integer between 0 and 90 degrees.
