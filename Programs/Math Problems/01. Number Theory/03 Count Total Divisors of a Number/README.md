# Count Total Divisors of a Number

## Problem Statement

Write a function to count the total number of divisors of a given number `n`.

## Input

- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print the total number of divisors of `n`.

## Example

### Input

```
12
```

### Output

```
6
```

### Input

```
15
```

### Output

```
4
```

### Explanation

- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 (total of 6 divisors).
- The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15 (total of 4 divisors).

## Constraints

- The input number `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

## Note

- A divisor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder.
