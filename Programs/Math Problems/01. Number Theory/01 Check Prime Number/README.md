# Check Prime Number

## Problem Statement

Write a function to check if a number is prime or not.

## Input

- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print "YES" if `n` is prime, otherwise print "NO".

## Example

### Input

```
7
```

### Output

```
YES
```

### Input

```
4
```

### Output

```
NO
```

## Explanation

- 7 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- 4 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4.

## Constraints

- The input number `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

## Note

- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
