# Find All Primes in a Range [L, R]

## Problem Statement

Write a function to find all prime numbers in a given range [L, R].

## Input

- Two integers L and R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print all prime numbers in the range [L, R], each on a new line.

## Example

### Input

```
1 10
```

### Output

```
2 3 5 7
```

### Input

```
10 25
```

### Output

```
11 13 17 19 23
```

### Explanation

- The prime numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
- The prime numbers between 10 and 25 are 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.

### Constraints

- The input numbers L and R are guaranteed to be positive integers.
- The range [L, R] can be large, so the solution should be efficient.

## Note

- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
