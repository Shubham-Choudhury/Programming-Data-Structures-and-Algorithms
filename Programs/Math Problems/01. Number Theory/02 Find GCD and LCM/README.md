# Find GCD and LCM

## Problem Statement

Write a function to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers.

## Input

- Two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print the GCD and LCM of `a` and `b`.

## Example

### Input

```
12 15
```

### Output

```
3 60
```

### Input

```
17 19
```

### Output

```
1 323
```

### Explanation

- The GCD of 12 and 15 is 3, and the LCM is 60.
- The GCD of 17 and 19 is 1, and the LCM is 323.

## Constraints

- The input numbers `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be positive integers.

## Note

- The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
- The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.
