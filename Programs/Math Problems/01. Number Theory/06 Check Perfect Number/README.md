# Check Perfect Number

## Problem Statement

Write a function to check if a given number `n` is a perfect number.

## Input

- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print "YES" if `n` is a perfect number, otherwise print "NO".

## Example

### Input

```
6
```

### Output

```
YES
```

### Input

```
28
```

### Output

```
YES
```

### Input

```
7
```

### Output

```
NO
```

### Explanation

- The number 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, 3) sum up to 6.
- The number 28 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14) sum up to 28.
- The number 7 is not a perfect number because its only divisor (1) does not sum up to 7.

## Constraints

- The input number `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

## Note

- A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding itself.
