# Check Palindrome Number

## Problem Statement

Write a function to check if a given number `n` is a palindrome.

## Input

- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)

## Output

- Print "YES" if `n` is a palindrome, otherwise print "NO".

## Example

### Input

```
12321
```

### Output

```
YES
```

### Input

```
1234
```

### Output

```
NO
```

### Explanation

- The number 12321 reads the same backward as forward, so it is a palindrome.
- The number 1234 does not read the same backward as forward, so it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints

- The input number `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

## Note

- A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
