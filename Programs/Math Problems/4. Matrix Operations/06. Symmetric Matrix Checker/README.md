# Symmetric Matrix Checker

## Problem Statement

Given a square matrix, determine if it is symmetric or not.
A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose. In other words, a matrix A is symmetric if $A[i][j] = A[j][i]$ for all $i$ and $j$.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer N, the size of the matrix.
- The next N lines contain N integers each, representing the elements of the matrix.
- The elements of the matrix are separated by spaces.
- The elements of the matrix are integers and can be positive or negative.

## Output

- If the matrix is symmetric, print "YES".
- If the matrix is not symmetric, print "NO".

## Example

### Input

```
3
1 2 3
2 4 5
3 5 6
```

### Output

```
YES
```
