# Remove Consecutive Duplicate Characters from a String

`Deloitte NLA [for BCA/B.Sc(CS/IT)]`

You are given a string, S. Your task is to write a program to remove duplicates only in its surroundings, such as AAAAABBBCCDDAAACC -> ABCDAC.

Read the input from STDIN and print the output to STDOUT. Do not write arbitrary strings anywhere in the program, as these contribute to the standard output and test cases will fail.

## Constraints

- The length of S <= 300000

## Input Format

- A single line of input contains a string S.

## Output Format

- The output must display the modified string S by removing duplicates in its surroundings.

### Sample Input

```
AAAAABBBCCDDAAACC
```

### Sample Output

```
ABCDAC
```

### Explanation

- Given a string, S is "AAAAABBBCCDDAAACC". So, by removing the duplicates in its surroundings the output is printed as ABCDAC.
